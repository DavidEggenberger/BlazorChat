# Blazor Chat

Blazor WASM chat app with an ASP.NET Core backend from my Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador Workshop. It uses ASP.NET Core Identity to enable 2FA authentication and integrate with Social Login Providers (LinkedIn, Github). SignalR is used for realtime chatting. IdentityServer is used to issue the Access and Id tokens.
